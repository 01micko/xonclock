About
=====

  xonclock is X on-screen analog clock displayer with assignable skins.
Originally the program was written to work under the Window Maker 0.91.0
windows manager.

  I'm not the Linux programming guru so if you've found a bug don't swear at
me but better fix it and give me a patch ;).

  The project summary page can be found at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/xonclock.

Requirements
============

  * libpng-1.2.13 (http://www.libpng.org/)
  * jpeg-6b (http://www.ijg.org/)
  * tiff-3.8.2 (http://www.libtiff.org/)
  * libXpm-3.5.5 (http://xorg.freedesktop.org/)
  * make-3.80 (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/)
  * gcc-3.3.2 (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/)
  * XFree-4.3.0 (http://www.xfree.org/) or XOrg-6.8.2 (http://www.x.org/)

  * FreeType2-2.1.9 (http://freetype.sourceforge.net/)

The full agreement with versions numbers of these packages aren't
required I hope.
